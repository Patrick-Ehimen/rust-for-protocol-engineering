# Walkthrough: Your Rust Blockchain Journey

We have successfully designed a comprehensive 10-month roadmap to take you from a Rust beginner to an interview-ready Protocol Engineer.

## The 10-Month Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Timeline | Primary Goal | Key Project |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Bootcamp** | Month 1 | Master Rust Basics | Rustlings / CLI Exercises |
| **Data Tooling**| Months 2-3 | Backend Foundations | [Indexer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) & Vault-CLI |
| **Networking** | Months 4-5 | Distributed Systems | P2P Gossip Node |
| **VMs & Core** | Months 6-7 | Language Runtime | Stack-based VM |
| **Scaling (L2)** | Months 8-9 | Protocol Design | Rollup Sequencer |
| **Readiness** | Month 10 | Career & Open Source| Portfolio & OS Contributions |

## Core Competencies You Will Build
- **Memory Safety**: Deep understanding of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Mastering high-concurrency systems with `Tokio`.
- **Protocol Engineering**: Designing BFT consensus, P2P networking, and Virtual Machines.
- **Layer 2 Architectures**: Building sequencers and state-transition logic for rollups.

## Next Steps
1. **Start Month 1**: Download [Rustings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) and start the exercises.
2. **Setup environment**: Ensure you have `rustup`, `cargo`, and a good IDE (VS Code with rust-analyzer is recommended).
3. **Weekly Check-ins**: I can help you with specific exercises or code reviews as you progress through each project.

> [!TIP]
> Don't rush the first month. Ownership and Lifetimes are the hardest parts of Rust. Once you master them, the rest of the systems programming will feel much more intuitive.
