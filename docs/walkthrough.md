# Walkthrough: Your Rust Blockchain Journey

We have successfully designed a comprehensive 10-month roadmap to take you from a Rust beginner to an interview-ready Protocol Engineer.

## The 10-Month Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Timeline | Primary Goal | Total Projects |
|-------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **The Gauntlet**| Month 1 | Extreme Muscle Memory | 16 Mini-Projects|
| **Data Tooling**| Months 2-3 | Storage & Analytics | 5 Advanced |
| **Networking** | Months 4-5 | Distributed Systems | 6 Specialised |
| **Core Systems**| Months 6-7 | Virtual Machines | 6 Protocol |
| **Scaling (L2)** | Months 8-9 | Future Protocols | 3 Elite |
| **Readiness** | Month 10 | Career & OS | Open Source |

## Core Competencies You Will Build
- **Extreme Rust Mastery**: 36 hands-on projects covering the entire language surface.
- **Protocol Engineering**: Building BFT consensus, Custom VMs, and Gossip networks.
- **DeFi & Scaling Infrastructure**: Indexers, Rollup sequencers, and ZK-Verifiers.
- **Real-world Utility**: Building actual tools like Price Trackers and Portfolio Analyzers.

## Next Steps
1. **Start Month 1**: Download [Rustings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) and start the exercises.
2. **Setup environment**: Ensure you have `rustup`, `cargo`, and a good IDE (VS Code with rust-analyzer is recommended).
3. **Weekly Check-ins**: I can help you with specific exercises or code reviews as you progress through each project.

> [!TIP]
> Don't rush the first month. Ownership and Lifetimes are the hardest parts of Rust. Once you master them, the rest of the systems programming will feel much more intuitive.
