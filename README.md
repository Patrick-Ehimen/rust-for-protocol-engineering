# Rust for Protocol Engineering: 10-Month Mastery Roadmap

> A high-intensity, project-based curriculum designed to transform a Rust beginner into an interview-ready Blockchain Protocol Engineer through 36 hands-on projects.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the ultimate 10-month roadmap for mastering Rust in the context of blockchain systems, protocol engineering, and scaling infrastructure. Unlike theoretical courses, this path is built on **The Gauntlet**—a series of 36 progressively difficult projects that build deep muscle memory and systems expertise.

### Key Highlights
- **10 Months** of structured, intense learning.
- **36 Projects** ranging from CLI utilities to custom Virtual Machines and L2 Sequencers.
- **Zero to Hero**: Dedicated Month 1 "Beginner Bootcamp" to ground the learner in Rust's unique memory model.
- **Systems-First**: Focused strictly on infrastructure (Networking, VMs, Consensus) rather than smart contract high-level logic.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To begin your journey with Week 1 of **The Gauntlet**:

1.  **Environment Setup**:
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    rustup toolchain install stable
    ```
2.  **Recommended Tooling**:
    - IDE: VS Code with [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
    - Resource: Keep [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) bookmarked.
3.  **Start Building**: Open [detailed_to_dos.md](docs/detailed_to_dos.md) and execute **Project 1: Universal Converter**.
